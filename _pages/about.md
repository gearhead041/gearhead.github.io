This is a site for my portfolio and also a place where I write about techy stuff for fun. I'm a backend web developer and I like to write about things I'm learning or things I'm working on. I'm also a big fan of open source software and I like to contribute to projects when I can. I'm currently working on a few projects that I'll be writing about soon.
